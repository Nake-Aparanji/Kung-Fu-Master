# Kung-Fu-Master
In this project, I have trained the ‘Kung-Fu Master’ agent twice using vanilla Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm – once using the Multi-layer Perceptron layers (MLP) and then using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I have then analyzed the performance of both these variants and concluded that CNN works better.
